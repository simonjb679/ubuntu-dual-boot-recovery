## üîß Problem Summary

After successfully installing Ubuntu as a dual-boot with Windows, Ubuntu disappeared from my system upon rebooting into Windows. The system booted directly into Windows, and BIOS only listed Windows Boot Manager. Ubuntu was inaccessible, and the EFI partition appeared broken or missing.
